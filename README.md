### Sample Prompts with Claude

#### Send an Email

> Note: sending an email currently (2025-03-18) seems to require a paid account with Anthropic. You'll get a silent failure on the free account

```
Can you send an email to EMAIL_HERE with a funny email body that makes it sound like it's from the IT Desk from Office Space?
Please use the sending domain DOMAIN_HERE, and make the email from "postmaster@DOMAIN_HERE"!
```

#### Fetch and Visualize Sending Statistics

```
Would you be able to make a chart with email delivery statistics for the past week?
```

## Debugging
